Protocol Buffers enables us to have type safety, make API faster and unify schema of structured data. JSON used to be a reasonable way for Web APIs in most cases, but Protocol Buffers could be another option if we consider these benefits. In this talk, you'll discover examples of usage with swift-protobuf in server and client apps. Yusuke will also highlight pros and cons compare to JSON based on his knowledge and experiences."
